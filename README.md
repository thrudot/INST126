#This is a basic caluculator made using python for a intro programming class. I am still new and learning python so this could be improved greatly as I improve!
The code prompts the user what operation they want to use in their calculation. The user must select a number in a list 1-5 that correlates to an operation.
Then the code will prompt the first number that is desired in the calculation. For division, the first number will be the number to be divided, the second will be the devisor.
#Note: For the factorial function, the code will prompt you for your "Second Number", but a factorial only reuqires one number. So you must enter a random number as a placeholder when the code prompts you. Only the "First Number" will be used in the factorial calcualtion.
The answer is printed out in an equation form.
